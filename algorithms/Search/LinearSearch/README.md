# Linear Search

> Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list in sequential order. We start at one end and check every element until the desired element is not found.

## How Linear Search Works?

The following steps are followed to search for an element in a given array. Initial array - Array to be searched for

- Start from the first element, compare k with each element x.

- Compare with each element, If x == k, return the index.

- Else, return not found.

## Complexity

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| :-------------: | :--------------: |
|      O(n)       |       O(1)       |

## Linear Search Applications

For searching operations in smaller arrays (<100 items).
