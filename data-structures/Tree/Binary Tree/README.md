# Binary Tree

> A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.

## Types of Binary Tree

- [`Full Binary Tree`](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/full-binary-tree) : A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
- [`Perfect Binary Tree`](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/perfect-binary-tree) : A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
- [`Complete Binary Tree`](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/complete-binary-tree) : A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences. Every level must be completely filled. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left. The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
- [`Balanced Binary Tree`](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/balanced-binary-tree) : It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
- `Degenerate or Pathological Tree` : A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.
- `Skewed Binary Tree` : A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes.

## Binary Tree Representation

A node of a binary tree is represented by a structure containing a data part and two pointers to other structures of the same type.

## Binary Tree Applications

- For easy and quick access to data
- In router algorithms
- To implement heap data structure
- Syntax tree
