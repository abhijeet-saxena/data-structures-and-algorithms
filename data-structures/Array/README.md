# Arrays

> ## An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array

JavaScript provides an Out Of The Box implementation of Arrays.
