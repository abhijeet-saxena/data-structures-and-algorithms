# Stacks

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

Mainly the following basic operations are performed in the stack:

- Push: Adds an item in the stack.
- Pop: Removes an item from the stack. (Reversed order in which they are pushed)
- Peek: Returns top element of stack.
- isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.
- size: Returns size of stack.
