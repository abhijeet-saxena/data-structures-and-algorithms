# Queues

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

Mainly the following basic operations are performed in Queue:

- Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. (same order in which they are pushed)
- isEmpty: Returns true if queue is empty, else false.
- size: Returns size of queue.
- Front: Get the front item from queue.
- Rear: Get the last item from queue.
